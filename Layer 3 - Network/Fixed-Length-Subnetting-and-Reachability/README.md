        <b>📋 Scenario:</b> Network engineers have deployed new infrastructure connecting two sites through a central router topology and subdivided the 192.168.1.0/24 network into four equal-sized subnets. The network diagram requires updated subnet labeling, and router interfaces need IP address assignments within their respective subnets to establish inter-network connectivity.

| 1 | The network diagram reflects a partially updated topology | Subnetted 192.168.1.0/24 into four equal /26 subnets by borrowing two host bits: 192.168.1.0/26, 192.168.1.64/26, 192.168.1.128/26, 192.168.1.192/26 — labeled each subnet and interface accordingly | Network diagram updated to reflect the new addressing scheme | <img src="Elements/step1.png"> |
| 2 | After assigning IP addresses to `R1`'s `Gi0/0/0` and `Se0/1/0` via `ip address <IP address> <IP subnet mask>`, both links remaind down — `show ip interface brief` confirms that these interfaces are administratively disabled | Issued `no shutdown` on both interfaces; repeated procedure for `R2` and `R3` | All interfaces assigned IP addresses within their respective subnets; all links active and OSPF adjacencies formed between routers according to Syslog messages | <img src="Elements/step2.png"> |
| 3 | Testing connectivity from `PC5` to remote hosts and servers across both sites | Tested with `ping` via Windows Command Prompt | Communication successful — issued `write` on all updated devices to save configuration | <img src="Elements/step3.png"> |
| 4 | Layer 7 connectivity not yet verified | Visited Cisco.com via web browser | HTTP response received successfully — Application Layer confirmed operational | <img src="Elements/step4.png"> |

### Conclusion
The provisioning tasks required to establish inter-network connectivity were completed in the following order:
1. **Subnetting:** 192.168.1.0/24 subdivided into four equal /26 subnets and network diagram amended
2. **Addressing:** IP addresses assigned to all router interfaces within their respective subnets
3. **Activation:** Administratively down interfaces brought up with `no shutdown`
