        <b>📋 Scenario:</b> Network engineers have deployed new infrastructure connecting two sites through a central router topology and subdivided the 192.168.1.0/24 network into four equal-sized subnets. The network diagram requires updated subnet labeling, and router interfaces need IP address assignments within their respective subnets to establish inter-site connectivity.

### Steps
| Step | Observation | Action Taken | Result | Image |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---:| 
| 1 | `SW1` is plugged into electrical outlet, verified electrical outlet is working using a known-good device (receptable tester/phone charger connected to phone), reconnected power cable to no effect, `SW1` power switch is in the **OFF** position | Toggled power switch to **ON** | `Fa0/2` LEDs illuminate; `Fa0/1` remains unlit | <img src="Elements/step1.png"> |
| 2 | Local RJ45 connector is fully seated in `SW1`'s `Fa0/1`, TDR device indicates an open circuit on the far end of the physical link, remote end found disconnected from `PC1`'s `Fa0`, the end user reports accidental disconnection of the RJ45 connector | Reconnected cable to `PC1`'s `Fa0` to close the electrical circuit loop | No change; `Fa0/1` LEDs remain unilluminated | <img src="Elements/step2.png"> |
| 3 | Connecting to the device's CLI terminal through the console port and using the `show ip interface brief` command to check interface status reveals that `Fa0/1`'s link status is administratively down | Issued `no shutdown` on interface | Link status and line protocol are up/up — the port LED is illuminated, indicating that a link has been successfully established. | <img src="Elements/step3.png"> |
| 4 | Both hosts appear to have link connectivity according to their blinking interface LEDs | Tested communication using `ping` via Windows Command Prompt | Communication successful — `write` executed to save configuration state on all updated devices. | <img src="Elements/step4.png"> |

### Conclusion
The root cause was a combination of Layer 1 failures:
1. **Physical:** Disconnected cable and unpowered switch
2. **Administrative:** `shutdown` applied to interface

All three conditions required correction to restore full connectivity.

## Bonus Tips
### Tip #1 - The `show ip interface brief` command provides a quick health check of all interfaces. For diagnosing Layer 1 issues, check the link status and line protocol columns:
- **Administratively Down / Down** — Interface is disabled with `shutdown` command
- **Down / Down** — Possible causes include an absent or damaged cable, improperly seated connectors, incorrect cable type or pinout, or a local/remote interface or device that is powered off, misconfigured, or faulty.

        <i>Example: Despite issuing `no shutdown`, interface Fa0/1 remains in a down/down state because the cable is disconnected</i>

> 💡 **Quick Tip(s):**  When a link fails to establish, the fault lies in the cable, local device, remote device, or **any of their respective interfaces**. Start at Layer 1 and work up:
> 
> **Without specialized test equipment:**
> - Verify both cable ends are firmly seated
> - If still down → Replace with known-good cable
>   - If link comes up → Original cable was faulty
>   - If link stays down → Investigate devices and/or interfaces
> 
> **With TDR/OTDR (copper/fiber cable testers):**
> - Run TDR/OTDR first to detect opens, shorts, or impedance faults
>   - Most modern cable testers include built-in TDR/OTDR; some switches/routers have diagnostic commands
>   - If fault detected → Reseat both ends, then replace cable if issue persists
>   - If clean results (proper termination, no faults) → Skip cable replacement and go directly to device/interface investigation
>
> **Device/interface investigation:**
> - Check speed/duplex settings, admin status, configuration mismatches, and hardware failures on both ends
