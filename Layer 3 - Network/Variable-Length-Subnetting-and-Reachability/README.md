        <b>📋 Scenario:</b> A 192.168.1.0/24 network was previously subnetted into four equal /26 subnets to support an initial deployment. A newly installed site requires an additional subnet carved from the same address space — one of the existing /26 subnets must be broken down into the maximum number of subnets supporting at least 8 hosts each. The last of those resulting subnets must be further subdivided into /30s to accommodate point-to-point links and conserve address space.

### Entries
| # | Notes | Action Taken | Result | Image |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---:|
| 1 | Site 3 requires at least 8 host addresses — 3 PCs, `R3`'s `Gi0/0/0`, `SW3`'s management address, and 3 reserved for future growth — a minimum of 4 host bits must remain unborrowed from the available 6 in the /26 (2⁴ - 2 = 14 usable hosts); borrowing 2 bits yields four /28 subnets: 192.168.1.64/28, 192.168.1.80/28, 192.168.1.96/28, and 192.168.1.112/28 | Assigned 192.168.1.64/28 to Site 3 — updated network diagram labeling and assigned host addresses accordingly; verified allocation by pinging all assigned addresses from `R4` | All hosts on Site 3 reachable — network diagram updated to reflect new addressing scheme | <img src="Elements/step1.png"> |
| 2 | Three point-to-point links require /30 subnets — borrowing 2 bits from 192.168.1.112/28 yields four /30 subnets (2² - 2 = 2 usable hosts each): 192.168.1.112/30, 192.168.1.116/30, 192.168.1.120/30, and 192.168.1.124/30 | Assigned /30 subnets to each point-to-point link — updated diagram labeling and reassigned first and last usable addresses to each interface; verified from internet router `R3` by using `traceroute` command to hosts on each respective subnet | All point-to-point links addressed correctly — address space conserved | <img src="Elements/step2.png"> |
| 3 | Application Layer connectivity not yet verified | Visited facebook.com via web browser | HTTP response received successfully — Application Layer confirmed operational | <img src="Elements/step3.png"> |

### Conclusion
The provisioning tasks required to establish inter-network connectivity were completed in the following order:
1. **Subnetting:** 192.168.1.0/24 subdivided into four equal /26 subnets and network diagram amended
2. **Addressing:** IP addresses assigned to all router interfaces within their respective subnets
3. **Activation:** Administratively down interfaces brought up with `no shutdown`
