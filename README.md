# Information
Hands-on networking lab portfolio showcasing practical experience in switching, routing, and security configurations. Labs progress from foundational setups to increasingly advanced implementations, emphasizing both depth and real-world applicability.

Content is organized using the TCP/IP 5-layer model, with each lab categorized by the highest layer it meaningfully interacts with. Labs are also aligned with the most common networking lifecycle scenarios, covering **Provisioning**, **Maintenance**, and **Troubleshooting**.

A range of simulators and emulators are valid options depending on lab complexity, ensuring both accessibility and realistic network behavior. Emulator/Simulator software considered but not limited to:

## General Commands
### Cisco IOS / IOS XE
- **`enable`**  
Transitions the user from `user EXEC` mode (the initial, limited-access CLI mode) to `privileged EXEC` mode, granting access to advanced monitoring and configuration commands.
- **`configure terminal`**  
Enters `global configuration` mode from `privileged EXEC` mode, allowing the user to modify the device’s running configuration.
- **`?`**  
Provides context-sensitive help:
  - When used after a command with a space (e.g., `show ?`), it displays available subcommands or arguments.
  - When used immediately after a partial command (e.g., `con?`), it attempts to show matching options.
  - In context-sensitive help, `<cr>` (carriage return) indicates that the command is complete and can be executed by pressing `Enter`. Additional arguments may still be available, but they are optional when `<cr>` is shown.
- **`no`**  
Negates or removes a commands effect when prefixed before the command . This is commonly used to disable features or delete configuration statements (e.g., `no shutdown`, `no ip address`).
- **`do`**  
Allows execution of `privileged EXEC` mode commands while in various configuration modes, such as `global configuration` mode.
> 💡 **Quick Tips:**
> - Press `TAB` to autocomplete a partially typed command or keyword.
> - Use the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys to navigate through command history. Press `ENTER` to execute a selected command..
> - Press `Ctrl + A` to move the cursor to the beginning of the command line.
> - Press `Ctrl + E` to move the cursor to the end of the command line.
