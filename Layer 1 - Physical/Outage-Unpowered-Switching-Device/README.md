      <b>📋 Scenario:</b> Two hosts connected to a common Layer 2 device are unable to communicate with each other. The device exhibits no link-layer connectivity, and all interface LEDs on the switching device are dark—suggesting an absence of electrical power.

### Steps
| Step | Observation | Action Taken | Result | Image |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---:| 
| 1 | `SW1` is plugged into electrical outlet, verified electrical outlet is working using a known-good device (receptable tester/phone charger connected to phone), reconnected power cable to no effect, `SW1` power switch is in the **OFF** position | Toggled power switch to **ON** | `Fa0/2` LEDs illuminate; `Fa0/1` remains unlit | <img src="Elements/Step1.png"> |
| 2 | Cable connecting `PC1` to `SW1` via `Fa0/1` is disconnected | Reconnected cable to `Fa0/1` | No change; `Fa0/1` LEDs remain unilluminated | <img src="Elements/Step2.png"> |
| 3 | `Fa0/1` is administratively down | Issued `no shutdown` on interface | Port LED illuminates; link established | <img src="Elements/Step3.png"> |
| 4 | Both hosts have link connectivity | Tested with `ping` | Communication successful | <img src="Elements/Step4.png"> |

## Bonus Tips
### Tip #1 - The `show ip interface brief` command provides a quick health check of all interfaces. A status of **`down/down`** indicates a Layer 1 issue:

- **Administratively Down / Down** — Interface is disabled with `shutdown` command
- **Down / Down (with cable connected)** — Possible faulty cable, incorrect cable type, or defective interface
- **Down / Down (no cable)** — No physical connection detected

> 💡 **Quick Tip(s):** A cable connects two devices. If the link doesn't come up, the fault could be the cable, the local interface, or **the remote device on the other end**. Swap with a known-good cable first:
> - If the link comes up → Original cable was faulty
> - Link remains down → Investigate both the local port and the far-end device

## Conclusion
The root cause was a combination of Layer 1 failures:
1. **Physical:** Disconnected cable and unpowered switch
2. **Administrative:** Interface in `shutdown` state

All three conditions required correction to restore full connectivity.
