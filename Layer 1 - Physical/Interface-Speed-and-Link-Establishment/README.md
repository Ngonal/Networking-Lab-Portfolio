        <b>📋 Scenario:</b> Two switches were recently replaced with new hardware. Following the replacement, the interswitch link fails to establish — users on both segments lose connectivity entirely. The decommissioned switches did not exhibit this behavior.

### Steps
| Step | Observation | Action Taken | Result | Image |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---:|
| 1 | `show interfaces status` on `SW3` reveals `Gi1/0/1` is hard-coded to 10 Mbps — atypical, as interfaces are expected to auto-negotiate speed by default, and immediately suggests misconfiguration; given the link is entirely down, a speed mismatch with `SW4` is suspected | Issued `speed auto` on `SW3` `Gi1/0/1`; confirmed with `show interfaces Gi1/0/1 status` | `SW3` negotiates to `SW4`'s hard-coded speed; link establishes | <img src="Elements/Step1.png"> |
| 2 | `show interfaces status` on `SW4` reveals `Gi1/0/1` is hard-coded to 100 Mbps — confirms the speed mismatch that caused the initial link failure | Issued `speed auto` on `SW4` `Gi1/0/1`; confirmed with `show interfaces Gi1/0/1 status` | Both interfaces now set to auto-negotiate; configuration normalized on both switches | <img src="Elements/Step2.png"> |
| 3 | Both hosts are now able to communicate | Tested with `ping` via Windows Command Prompt | Communication successful | <img src="Elements/Step3.png"> |

### Conclusion
The root cause was a speed mismatch introduced during hardware replacement:
1. **SW3 Gi1/0/1:** Hard-coded to 10 Mbps
2. **SW4 Gi1/0/1:** Hard-coded to 100 Mbps

Setting `SW3 Gi1/0/1` to auto-negotiate allowed it to match `SW4`'s hard-coded speed, restoring the interswitch link. `SW4` was subsequently set to auto-negotiate to normalize configuration across both switches.

## Bonus Tips
### Tip #1 - Hard-coded interface speeds are a red flag. Interfaces are expected to auto-negotiate speed by default — an explicit speed setting immediately suggests intentional or erroneous misconfiguration:
- **`speed 10`, `speed 100`, `speed 1000`**
Forces the speed in Mbps regardless of what the other end supports
- **`speed auto`**
Allows the interface to negotiate speed with the remote end (default behavior)

> 💡 **Quick Tip(s):** There are rare legitimate reasons to hard-code speed — older devices that do not support auto-negotiation reliably may require it. However, in modern environments both ends should always be set to `speed auto` unless there is a specific documented reason not to. If you inherit a network where speeds are hard-coded, treat it as a misconfiguration until proven otherwise.
