        <b>📋 Scenario:</b> Two switches were recently replaced with new hardware. Following the replacement, the interswitch link fails to establish — users on both segments lose connectivity entirely. The decommissioned switches did not exhibit this behavior.

### Steps
| Step | Observation | Action Taken | Result | Image |
|:---:|:---|:---|:---|:---:|
| 1 | `show interfaces status` on `SW3` reveals `Gi1/0/1` is hard-coded to 10 Mbps; given the link is entirely down, a speed mismatch with `SW4` is suspected | Issued `speed auto` on `SW3` `Gi1/0/1`; confirmed with `show interfaces Gi1/0/1 status` | `SW3` negotiates to `SW4`'s hard-coded speed; link establishes | <img src="Elements/Step1.png"> |
| 2 | `show interfaces Gi1/0/1 status` on `SW4` reveals `Gi1/0/1` is hard-coded to 100 Mbps — confirms the speed mismatch that caused the initial link failure | Issued `speed auto` on `SW4` `Gi1/0/1`; confirmed with `show interfaces Gi1/0/1 status` | Both interfaces now set to auto-negotiate; configuration normalized on both switches | <img src="Elements/Step2.png"> |
| 3 | Both hosts are now able to communicate | Tested with `ping` via Windows Command Prompt | Communication successful | <img src="Elements/Step3.png"> |

### Conclusion
The root cause was a combination of Layer 1 failures:
1. **Physical:** Disconnected cable and unpowered switch
2. **Administrative:** Interface in `shutdown` state

All three conditions required correction to restore full connectivity.

## Bonus Tips
### Tip #1 - The `show ip interface brief` command provides a quick health check of all interfaces. A status of **`down/down`** indicates a Layer 1 issue:

- **Administratively Down / Down** — Interface is disabled with `shutdown` command
- **Down / Down (with cable connected)** — Possible faulty cable, incorrect cable type/pinout, or defective devices/interfaces
- **Down / Down (no cable)** — No physical connection detected (self-explanatory)

> 💡 **Quick Tip(s):** A cable connects two devices. If the link doesn't come up despite a physical connection, the fault could be the cable, the local device, the remote device, or **any of their respective interfaces**. Swap with a known-good cable first:
> - If the link comes up → Original cable was faulty
> - Link remains down → Investigate both devices and their interfaces on each end
> - Use a **TDR** (Time Domain Reflectometer) to quickly check for shorts or opens along the cable run — this can reveal faults on the far end without physically accessing it — Most modern cable testers include built-in TDR functionality
